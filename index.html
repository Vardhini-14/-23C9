            <h1>Quick Sort</h1>
            <p>Quick sort is a commonly used sorting algorithm that is often preferred over other sorting algorithms due to its efficiency and      effectiveness. It proceeds by splitting an array into two parts, one with elements smaller than a selected pivot element and the other with   elements bigger than the pivot. The algorithm then applies this procedure recursively to each partition until the complete array is sorted.
            </p>    
            <p>Quick sort can be used in any scenario where sorting is required, such as in database applications, scientific computing, and web applications. It is frequently utilized when a large dataset must be rapidly and effectively sorted. Some specific use cases where quick sort is commonly used include:</p>
            <div class="we">
                <ul>
                    <li>Sorting arrays in programming languages such as C, Java, and Python.</li>
                    <li>Sorting database records in database management systems.</li>
                    <li>Sorting large datasets in scientific computing, such as in numerical simulations and data analysis.</li>
                    <li>Sorting search results in web applications and e-commerce platforms.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Overall, quick sort is a versatile and widely used algorithm that can be applied in a variety of domains where sorting is required. Its low average-case time complexity and simplicity of execution make it an appealing choice for efficiently sorting large datasets.</p>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Quick sort has a fast average-case time complexity of O(nlogn), making it efficient for large datasets.</li>
                <li>It is a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm that can be implemented in a few lines of code.</li>
                <li>Quick sort can be easily parallelized, making it suitable for use on multicore and distributed systems.</li>
                <li>It is an in-place sorting algorithm, which means that it does not require additional memory to store temporary variables or data structures.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Quick sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) if the pivot element is chosen poorly or the data is already sorted.</li>
                <li>It is not a stable sorting algorithm, which means that it does not guarantee the relative order of equal elements in the sorted array.</li>
                <li>Quick sort is not suitable for sorting large datasets that do not fit in memory, as it requires multiple passes over the data.</li>
